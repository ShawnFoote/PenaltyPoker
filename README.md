# PenaltyPoker
App created to make a bar game easier to play. Intended to be played while watching an NFL game. You play Straight, with each quarter being a hand, but with a twist: the dealer keeps track of accepted penalties in the game, and after the fifth flag, additional cards are handed out for each additional penalty.
